When you want to do something, but for the love of tangerines, you can't do it until something else has occurred; that's whenjs.

barebones example:

  var foo = 2;

  when(function () {
    return foo == 5
  }).do(function () {
    alert('foo now equals 5');
  });
  
  function doStuff() {
    //doing a bunch of stuff;
    foo = 5;
  }
  
  doStuff();
